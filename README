This is a basic implementation of the Novation Nocturn USB Controller [1] protocol, meant for Linux. The protocol was reverse-engineered by felicitus (timoahummel on github). This project will (hopefully) eventually allow the Nocturn to be used as a normal MIDI control surface in Linux. It is still very, very far from that.

The configuration file should be self explanatory.  Right now, all that can be done is setting the 8 rotary encoders to midi channels and cc's, and they will send and display values from 0 to 127 (no reception of midi events yet). Buttons are still being worked on, too.

There is also an included udev rule - put it where your distro keeps udev rules.  For Arch, that is
/etc/udev/rules.d
The rule will put chgrp the Nocturn to "users" so make sure you are in that group.

Run the Nocturn2.py script with
	python2 Nocturn2.py
and enjoy!

I am not experienced in Python (or programming in general), so please forgive any un-Pythonic code (or bad programming in general).
