This is a basic implementation of the Novation Nocturn USB Controller [1] protocol, meant for Linux.  The protocol was reverse-engineered by felicitus (timoahummel on github). This project will (hopefully) eventually allow the Nocturn to be used as a normal MIDI control surface in Linux. It is still very, very far from that.

I am not experienced in Python (or programming in general), so please forgive any un-Pythonic code (or bad programming in general).
